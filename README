MULTI-DATA SOURCE MODELING AND INVERSION TOOLKIT

MudPy v.0.5
Diego Melgar
Scripps Institution of Oceanography

A code to run forward models of dislocation sources as well as invert for them 
with multiple geophysical data types:

** Data types that MudPy can simulate and invert:
	+ Displacement seismograms
	+ Velocity seismograms
	+ Static field vectors
	+ Tsunami waveforms (under development)
	+ Strain offsets (under development)

** MudPy can do:

FORWARD MODELING of static point source
FORWARD MODELING of static slip distributions
FORWARD MODELING of kinematic point sources
FORWARD MODELING of kinematic slip distributions

** MudPy will soon do:

INVERSION of a static point source
INVERSION of static slip distributions
INVERSION of kinematic point sources
INVERSION of kinematic slip distributions

Not a whole lot of documentation since I'm still working on this although the 
code is thoroughly commented.

NOTES:
Uses fk code from Zhu & Rivera (2002, GJI) for Green functions calculations. This 
code is bundled here but make sure to refer to the original source for updates.
